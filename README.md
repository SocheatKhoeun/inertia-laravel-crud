## Laravel 
Laravel is a free, open-source PHP framework used to build web applications. It's popular for its easy-to-use features and clean code structure. Here are some key things Laravel helps with:

1. Routing: Defining and managing URLs for your application.
2. Middleware: A way to filter and process HTTP requests entering your application.
2. Eloquent ORM: An easy way to work with your database without writing SQL.
3. Blade Templating: A simple engine for creating reusable views (pages).
4. Artisan CLI: A command-line tool that helps with common tasks like running migrations or generating code.
5. Security: Protects your app against common security threats like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
6. Authentication: Built-in tools for user login and permissions.
7. Migrations: Easily version-control your database schema.
8. Task Scheduling: Automates tasks like sending emails at set times.
